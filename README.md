<p>
now what is this trainwreck of a website you may ask
  
it's made of html and css

the javascript is part of an interpreter that's mostly made in html using <script> for uhhhh... guess.

in case you couldn't, it's for interpreting the brainfuck because you dont natively run that in an html website idiot

and originally i made snake in assembly (yep i didnt write code to make it in assembly i just. made it in assembly.) but after dosbox-ing it the exe was corrupted or something cause the ascii chars wouldnt render properly

(honestly probs something to do with the fact that it's a commandline game kekw)

anyways this is a wip, the snake is going to be an easter egg when im done and not just a thing you can access like other tabs

and yes the working snake you see in the website is coded entirely in brainfuck with the interpreter in snake.html

update so i decided to try and make the slither snake animation in gleam and js i kinda hate myself if it wasnt obvious
