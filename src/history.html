  <p id="header">Our History</p>

  <p id="intro" style="padding: 0px 25px 0px 25px">We are team 15157, and our FTC rookie year was 2018. Our name, "IFC", was originally Invicta Ferro Canibus (invincible iron dog in Latin). Our mascot was the bulldog, representing our school's mascot of the bulldog. However, at the beginning of the 2024-25 season, we decided that capybaras were much cuter, so we changed our name IFC to stand for Invicta Ferro Capybaras. We now have a new mascot of a capybara, and even have a capybara stuffed animal.</p>
